# Digital Logic

## Description

This repository is dedicated to the **Digital Logic** module's laboratory work, completed during studies at KTU. The module covers the fundamental concepts of digital logic, including logic gates, combinational and sequential circuits, and their implementation in practical tasks.

## Content

The laboratory work covers the following topics:

- **Logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc.)**
- **Sequential circuits**
- **Truth tables and Karnaugh maps**
- **FSM (Finite State Machine) modeling**
- **Digital systems design**

Each directory contains theoretical exercises, their solutions, and the implementations of logic circuits.
